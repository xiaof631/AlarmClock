# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive dark mode, light mode, and automatic theme switching capabilities to the alarm clock application. Users will be able to manually select their preferred theme or have the app automatically follow the system appearance settings. The implementation will ensure consistent theming across all UI components while maintaining accessibility standards and providing a seamless user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually select between dark mode and light mode, so that I can use the app with my preferred visual appearance regardless of system settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses theme settings THEN the system SHALL display options for "Light", "Dark", and "Auto" modes
2. WHEN the user selects "Light" mode THEN the system SHALL apply light theme colors to all UI components immediately
3. WHEN the user selects "Dark" mode THEN the system SHALL apply dark theme colors to all UI components immediately
4. WHEN the user changes theme selection THEN the system SHALL persist the preference across app launches
5. IF the user has previously selected a theme THEN the system SHALL restore that theme on app startup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically follow my device's system appearance settings, so that the app's theme stays consistent with my overall device experience without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Auto" mode THEN the system SHALL automatically match the device's current appearance setting
2. WHEN the device switches from light to dark mode AND auto mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL immediately update the app theme to dark
3. WHEN the device switches from dark to light mode AND auto mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL immediately update the app theme to light
4. WHEN auto mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL respond to system appearance changes in real-time without requiring app restart
5. IF the system appearance cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL default to light mode

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all app screens and components to properly support both dark and light themes, so that I have a consistent and visually appealing experience throughout the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any theme is applied THEN the system SHALL update background colors for all views and screens
2. WHEN any theme is applied THEN the system SHALL update text colors to ensure proper contrast and readability
3. WHEN any theme is applied THEN the system SHALL update button colors, borders, and interactive element appearances
4. WHEN any theme is applied THEN the system SHALL update navigation elements including navigation bars and tab bars
5. WHEN any theme is applied THEN the system SHALL update form elements including text fields, pickers, and switches
6. WHEN any theme is applied THEN the system SHALL update list and table view appearances including separators and selection states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the theme implementation to maintain proper contrast ratios and accessibility features, so that I can use the app effectively regardless of my visual capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios between text and background colors
2. WHEN light mode is active THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios between text and background colors
3. WHEN any theme is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve accessibility labels and hints for screen readers
4. WHEN any theme is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus indicators for keyboard navigation
5. IF the user has system accessibility settings enabled THEN the system SHALL respect those settings in both themes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and immediate theme transitions, so that changing themes feels responsive and doesn't disrupt my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user changes theme manually THEN the system SHALL apply the new theme within 200 milliseconds
2. WHEN the system appearance changes in auto mode THEN the system SHALL apply the corresponding theme within 200 milliseconds
3. WHEN theme changes occur THEN the system SHALL update all visible UI elements simultaneously
4. WHEN theme changes occur THEN the system SHALL NOT cause any visual glitches or flickering
5. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL apply the correct theme before the first screen is fully rendered

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the app, I want the theme system to be extensible and maintainable, so that future UI updates can easily support both themes without significant refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new UI components are added THEN the system SHALL provide a standardized way to apply theme colors
2. WHEN theme colors need to be updated THEN the system SHALL allow changes in a centralized location
3. WHEN debugging theme issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging of theme state changes
4. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL validate that all required theme colors are defined for both light and dark modes
5. IF a theme color is missing THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback color and log a warning
