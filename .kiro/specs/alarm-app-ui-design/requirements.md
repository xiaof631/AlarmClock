# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive UI design system and high-fidelity mockups for an iOS alarm application. The design will be created in Figma with a focus on modern iOS design principles, accessibility, and user experience. The deliverable will be a complete design system with all necessary screens, components, and assets ready for development handoff.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a UI/UX designer, I want a complete design system with color palettes, typography, and component libraries, so that I can maintain consistency across all app screens and enable efficient design iteration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the design system THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive color palette with primary (#4A90E2 blue or #50E3C2 green), accent (#F5A623 orange), neutral, and text colors as specified
2. WHEN defining typography THEN the system SHALL use San Francisco font family with specified font weights (Bold, Semibold, Regular) and sizes (48pt for alarm time, 28pt for H1, 20pt for H2, 17pt for list items, 15pt for body text, 13pt for small text)
3. WHEN creating UI components THEN the system SHALL include buttons (primary, secondary, toggle switches), input fields, cards, list items, and time pickers following iOS design guidelines
4. WHEN establishing iconography THEN the system SHALL use SF Symbols where possible with custom icons at specified sizes (24x24pt for navigation, 20x20pt for list items, 40x40pt for scenarios)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed screen mockups for all key app interfaces, so that I can accurately implement the visual design and user interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the alarm list view THEN the screen SHALL display alarms in a list format with time (48pt bold), label, repeat cycle, toggle switch, and next alarm time
2. WHEN creating the alarm setup/edit view THEN the screen SHALL include time picker, label input, repeat settings, ringtone selection, snooze duration, volume slider, and delete option
3. WHEN designing scenario selection view THEN the screen SHALL display 10 life scenarios in grid/list format with icons and names
4. WHEN creating scenario template list THEN the screen SHALL show preset alarm templates for selected scenarios with names and descriptions
5. WHEN designing alarm alert interface THEN the screen SHALL display full-screen alarm time, label, visual effects, and snooze/stop buttons

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want responsive design layouts that work across different iOS devices, so that the app provides consistent user experience on all supported screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating layouts THEN designs SHALL adapt to iPhone screen sizes from iPhone SE to iPhone 15 Pro Max
2. WHEN designing for iPad THEN layouts SHALL optimize for larger screen real estate while maintaining usability
3. WHEN considering orientation THEN designs SHALL support both portrait and landscape modes where appropriate
4. WHEN defining spacing THEN layouts SHALL use consistent margins, padding, and grid systems across all screens

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an accessibility advocate, I want the design to meet accessibility standards, so that users with disabilities can effectively use the alarm application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining color contrast THEN all text-background combinations SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text
2. WHEN designing interactive elements THEN touch targets SHALL be minimum 44x44pt as per iOS guidelines
3. WHEN creating text hierarchy THEN designs SHALL support Dynamic Type scaling from small to accessibility sizes
4. WHEN labeling UI elements THEN all interactive components SHALL have clear accessibility labels for VoiceOver support

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized Figma files with proper naming conventions and export-ready assets, so that I can efficiently extract design specifications and assets for implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing Figma files THEN pages SHALL be structured logically (Design System, Screens, Components, Assets)
2. WHEN naming layers and components THEN naming SHALL follow consistent conventions (e.g., "Button/Primary/Default", "Screen/AlarmList/Default")
3. WHEN preparing assets THEN all icons and images SHALL be exportable at @1x, @2x, and @3x resolutions
4. WHEN documenting designs THEN specifications SHALL include measurements, colors (hex codes), font sizes, and spacing values
5. WHEN creating components THEN reusable elements SHALL be converted to Figma components with variants for different states

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user experience designer, I want interactive prototypes that demonstrate user flows, so that stakeholders can understand and validate the app's navigation and interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating prototypes THEN key user flows SHALL be interactive (add alarm, edit alarm, scenario selection, alarm alert)
2. WHEN defining transitions THEN animations SHALL match iOS native transition styles and timing
3. WHEN demonstrating interactions THEN prototypes SHALL show hover states, pressed states, and loading states where applicable
4. WHEN presenting flows THEN prototypes SHALL include realistic content and data examples

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want consistent visual identity elements throughout the design, so that the app maintains a cohesive brand presence and professional appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying visual style THEN all screens SHALL use the defined flat, modern design aesthetic
2. WHEN using imagery THEN scenario icons SHALL be recognizable, consistent in style, and culturally appropriate
3. WHEN designing layouts THEN card-based design patterns SHALL be used consistently for content grouping
4. WHEN creating visual hierarchy THEN proper use of whitespace, typography scale, and color SHALL guide user attention effectively
